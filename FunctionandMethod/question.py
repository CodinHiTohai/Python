#  Defining Functions
# Write a function greet() that prints "Hello, Python Learner!" when called.
# Write a function square(num) that returns the square of a given number. Test it with different numbers.
# 2. Function Arguments & Return Values
# Write a function full_name(first, last) that takes first name and last name as parameters and returns a single string in the format "First Last".

# Write a function calculate_area(length, width=10) that returns the area of a rectangle. Test it by calling the function with:

# Both length and width
# Only length (use default width)
# 3. Lambda Functions
# Write a lambda function that adds two numbers and test it.
# Create a list [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] and use map() with a lambda function to get their squares.
# 4. Recursion in Python
# Write a recursive function factorial(n) that returns the factorial of a number.
# Write a recursive function sum_of_digits(n) that returns the sum of all digits of a given number.


# Find the square root of 144
# Calculate sin(90°) (hint: use math.radians())


# 6. Variable Scope and Docstrings
# Write a function increment() that has a local variable counter initialized to 0 and increments it by 1 each time it is called. Observe whether the value persists across function calls.
# Write a function multiply(a, b) that has a proper docstring explaining what it does. Then use help(multiply) to display the docstring.
# 7. 
# Write a recursive function fibonacci(n) that prints the first n Fibonacci numbers.
# Write a function safe_divide(a, b) that returns the result of a / b, but returns "Cannot divide by zero" if b is 0.
# Create a small module my_utils.py with a function is_even(n) that returns True if n is even. Import and use it in another Python file.
